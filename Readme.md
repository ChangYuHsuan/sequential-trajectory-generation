## A Sequential Two-Step Algorithm for Fast Generation of Vehicle Racing Trajectories

This project implement the sequential two-step algorithm proposed by Nitin R. Kapania, et al.  
We collect the optimized trajectory and simulate the result using CarMaker where the optimized trajectory is combined with a feedback controller to compensate the disturbance error.
